# 40 Questions for Year-End Reflection
A questionnaire oriented toward what you made, learned, and confronted this year

## About

A year is long enough to forget what actually happened. You remember the highlights and lowlights, but the texture disappears—the gradual shifts, the small decisions that compounded, the things you meant to do but quietly abandoned.

Writing forces clarity that thinking alone doesn't. When you try to answer "what did I learn this year" in your head, you get a vague sense. When you have to write it down, you discover whether you actually know. These 40 questions can help the creator document what mattered and clarify what to focus on next.


## Background

This questionnaire was inspired by [Stephan Ango's "40 Questions to Ask Yourself Every Year"](https://stephanango.com/40-questions), which I was introduced to by [Leo Vogel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theleovogel/). Ango's tradition of annual reflection is a valuable one, and I wanted to create a version with a different emphasis—focused on production, skill development, and honest self-examination.

## Usage

Copy `year.md` and fill it in. The questions work best if you sit with them over several days rather than rushing through in one session.
